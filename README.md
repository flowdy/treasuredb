TreasureDB is a plain SQLite database application to observe and trace the finances of a
non-profit registered society or club.  The ideal state of balance is zero both in debit
and in credit because they even out. In Germany, such clubs may not accumulate reserves.

How does it work?
-----------------

There are four tables: Account, Credit, Debit and Transfers.

Account table stores the static details, i.e. the type of account, the record identifier for
another table that stores more information about the account owner, and the IBAN for outgoing
bank transfers.

The Credit table stores bank transfers from the member to the club, and also the target
records of internal transfers to the club and other members performing commercial services for
the club. The value of the former sort is initially >0 and normally not altered afterwards.
The latter's value always starts at 0 and is increased automatically by transfers linked to the
according debts.

The Debit table stores the receipts documenting a debt, their link to the credit record of the
respective recipient as well as to the account from which it is paid.

The Transfer stores when which amount is transferred from which credit record to settle which debt.
So, a debt can be associated with n source credits, and a souce credit can settle multiple debts.
Transfers cannot be altered once inserted, they need to be revoked and re-entered. This is due to
triggers that have to rebalance the involved accounts. Whenever the view Balance contains positive
values for both credit and debt in a line, this indicates transfers yet to be entered.


Installation
------------

As it is a SQLite3 database with all consistency and calculatory logic built in, you only
need the `sqlite3` binary or any sqlite3 GUI software to run it.

1. Ensure sqlite3 is installed

1. Run the test suite: `bash schema.t.sh` (on Linux and unix systems)

    # Or go by foot and test manually a little bit further
    treasuredb $ sqlite3
    SQLite version 3.8.7.1 2014-10-29 13:59:56
    Enter ".help" for usage hints.
    Connected to a transient in-memory database.
    Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
    sqlite> .read schema.sql
    
    sqlite> .read schema.t.sql
    ...

1. Setup the database: `sqlite3 treasure.db < schema.sql`

1. Study the files to learn how to work with the system: `less schema.sql schema.t.???`
