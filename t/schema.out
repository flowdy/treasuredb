# Now it is your turn: Study the sql code yielding the output above
# then enter new members and let them pay the fees.
# (PLUS: Let have one discalculia and pay too little or too much.)
# Once the club has enough money to pay alex' hosting service,
# update (i.e. revoke and reenter) the respective transaction.
# Finally issue a bank transfer to alex. Hint: An outgoing transfer
# is simply a debt charging alex' own virtual account and without
# targetCredit (NULL). PLUS: What happens if the description of
# the bank transfer does not contain any or only a wrong IBAN?
